I have seen experiments where people pushed Kentmere400 to 1600, but I think this will be the most I'll push this film.</p><p>Most of my images are in the 1/15-1/60 shutter speed range, resulting in a blurry or non-sharp look that I don't like in most cases, but it works for certain images here (I think).</p><p>When developing, I skipped the wetting agent and just gave it a distilled water bath in the end, but I still ended up with some water droplet marks. So, I gave it another wash with Ilfotol.</p><br><p>Camera: Pentax P30T</p><p>Lens: Pentax SMC FA 1:4-5.6 35-80mm</p><p>Film stock: Kentmere 400</p><p>Developer: D76 (1+1) for 17 minutes (+1 Push - i.e., Shot as ISO 800) at 20Â°C</p>"
